In this file do not use the equal sign in a comment because that is the triger to read an input.
I tried to set the units to what I saw people using. If I didn't know I used grams, meters, seconds and coulombs.
In the program I set the units to one that make the calculations more acurate. 
This make a unit numbers that you multiple by to convert internal numbers into grams, meters, seconds or coulombs. 
To get into our units take to grams, meters, seconds, or coulombs then divide by these unit numbers.

* Try and make this a power of 2 and even better a power of 32. Blocks can only get to 1024 and 
* and streaming multiprosessors have warps of 32.

* The hieght of the sheath in milimeters. double ( 10.6, 7.1, 3.22 were in the email from Dr. M)
SheathHeight = 10.6;

* Initial IonWake Charge as percent of the dust charge. I will start them out a zero and you can add them on when you feel they are needed. 
* Just reading them in here incase we want to start out at a nonzero sate in the future. double (Calvin said from 0.3 to 0.6)

* Cavity wall charge charge type force. This will be a number that radial pushes the particles towards the center.
* It will be a linear force that is multiplied by the dust charge and the distance out from the center of the cavity.
* Its units will be grams*seconds^-2*coulomb^-1. Double (1.8e6)
